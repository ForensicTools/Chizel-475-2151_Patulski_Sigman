#WELCOME TO CHIZEL. ENJOY!!!!!

##ABOUT
Chizel is a cloud storage integrator.  It streamlines the process of collecting cloud artifacts on a box in order to gain access to a cloud storage account.  When access to the account is granted, data stored on the cloud is collected, analyzed, and presented in a clear manner.  If Chizel can not gain access to the cloud storage account, it will analyze what it can from the box.

##INSTALLATION
Chizel is portable, so just run it from a flash drive or something.
Chizel can also be installed as an executable
